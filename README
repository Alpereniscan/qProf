A QGis plugin for creating profiles from DEM data. Status: experimental - many functions are still not implemented.

Currently working:
a) input from a linear shapefile (path) and a DEM, already loaded in a QGis project;
b) creating and plotting profile;
c) saving resulting profile as data (text file).
