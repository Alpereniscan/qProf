<h1>qProf - help</h1>

<div>
The purpose of this plugin is to help the creation of geological sections.
Georeferenced data such as topography, geological attitudes, geological outcrops can be combined to
	produce geological section.
</div>

<h2>Development</h2>
<div>
Created by M. Alberti (www.malg.eu) and M. Zanieri.
<br />Concept: M. Zanieri and M. Alberti, implementation: M. Alberti.
<br />We thank S. Peduzzi for his vigorous testing.

<h2>Workflow</h2>

Input topographic data are represented by one or more DEMs. Geological data are expressed by point, line or polygon layers that store
the geological attributes in the layer attribute tables.
The first, required step consists in the definition of the topographic profile.
Afterwards the processings can be devoted to the projection of geological information on the profile section, or to the
extraction of the intersection of line or polygonal elements with the define profile line.

<h2>Topography</h2>

	<br />Points are drawn on the slope map derived by a DEM, with elevations extracted from DEM ("dem_w4u3" in this case).

It is possible to create a topographic profile from one or more DEMs and a line digitized or stored in a layer, or directly 
from a GPX file storing track points. Data sources can be projected in different CRS,
and the created profiles will be in the project CRS.
When directly digitizing a line in the map, you add points wtih left clicks, and stops a line with a right click. 
<br /><br />When using a line layer, multiple lines will be merged into a single line, based on the 
chosen order field when available, or otherwise based on the internal line order.
Some artifacts in derived profiles can be due to erroneous line ordering, not corrected by 
defining an order in an integer field (order values start from 1).
<br /><br />When calculating a profile from DEM, you may define the 'Line densify distance',
i.e. the distance between consecutive sampling point automatically added
when the original vertices of the used path are distanced more than this value.
It is suggested to use a value comparable to the resolution of the used DEM,
for instance 30 m for Aster DEMs. A suggested value is added automatically based on the resolution
of the DEM with the highest spatial resolution.
br />The profile can be swap around the horizontal (x) axis or on the profile line. 
<br /><br />After having calculated the profile, you can plot its elevations and slopes (as degrees), abosulte or relative,
and save the results as a csv file, a 2D point shapefile or a 3D line shapefile.

<h2>Projections</h2>
Having defined and calculated a profile as previously described,
it is also possible to project geological attitudes or traces on the section.

<h3>Projection of geological attitudes</h3>

The geological attitudes source is a point layer: just selected points will be projected,
unless, in case of no selection, all points will be projected.
<br /> <br />Required fields are the geological point <i>id</i> and its surface orientation, expressed by <i>dip direction</i> and 
<i>dip angle</i> values.
<br />The geological attitudes can be projected on the section plane according to three
methods: 1) nearest point; 2) projection along a common axis; 3) projection along individual 
axes, for each geological record.
<br /> <br />When choosing the <i>Along axis projection - individual axes</i> option, <i>trend</i> and <i>plunge</i> fields,
storing the fold axis values along which to project each observation, are required in the source point layer. 
<br /><br />The results can be exported both as a csv file or as a 3D point shapefile.
        
<h3>Projection of trace lines</h3>
Geological traces can be projected on the section plane, based on a fold axis for which
trend and plunge values have to be defined.

<br />
<h2>Intersections</h2>
It is possible to determine the intersections of the profile (composed by just two points) with lines ("<i>Intersect line layer</i>") 
or with polygons ("<i>Intersect polygon layer</i>"), representing geological features.
An <i>Id</i> field and a <i>Classification</i> field can be provided, as an aid in plot visualization.

<br />
<h2>Result export</h2>

The last created figure can be saved as PDF, svg or tif. The export graphic parameters can
be saved in a text file and loaded for applying them to further plots.         
<br /><br />Result data can be exported ad shapefiles or csv files. Depending on the data type,
the output geometric formats can be line or point. The exported data CRS will be the same CRS defined for 
the QGis project.
<br /><br />Note: the slope is saved as relative (positive when upward, negative when downward), even if plotted as absolute. To change to aboslute value,
apply the absolute function on the relative field in a GIS or spreadsheet software.
