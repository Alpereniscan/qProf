<h1>qProf plugin help</h1>

<div>
	The purpose of this plugin is to help create geological profiles. Georeferenced data describing topography, geological outcrops and attitudes can be used.
	<br /><br />
	This plugin was realized by M. Alberti (<a href="http:\\www.malg.eu">www.malg.eu</a>) and M. Zanieri.
	<br />The original concept is by M. Zanieri, while the implementation is by M. Alberti.
	<br />Some people contributed with their suggestions and testing, among them we want to thank S. Peduzzi, for his vigorous testing.
</div>
<br />
<div>A few posts describing the plugin are:

<h2>1. General workflow</h2>

<div>
	To construct a geological profile, the first step consists in the construction of a topographic profile, with input data
	represented by one or more DEMs.
</div>
<br />
<div>
	Subsequently, we process geological data, expressed by point, line or polygon layers with useful
	geological attributes stored in the their attribute tables.
	<br />The subsequent processings can be:
	<ul>
		<li>the projection of geological attitudes on the profile section;</li>
		<li>the projection of geological lines;</li>
		<li>the intersection of geological lines (e.g., faults) on the profile section;</li>
		<li>the intersection of geological polygonal elements (e.g., outcrops) on the profile section.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	Last step is the export of the produced datasets as graphics and/or GIS data, for further elaborations in graphic or
	geological software.
</div>

<br />

<h2>2. Topographic profile creation</h2>

<div>
	It is possible to create a topographic profile in two ways:
	<ol>
		<li>from one or more DEMs and a line element, digitized or stored in a layer;
		<li>directly from a GPX file storing track points.</li>
	</ol>
	In the former case, data sources can be projected in different CRS, while the
	<u>created profile will be in the assigned project CRS</u>.
	<br />In the latter case, i.e. when creating a profile from a GPX file, the original latitude-longitude values are automatically converted
	to cartesian metric values, and from those the topographic profile is constructed.
</div>

<h3>2.1 Topographic profile creation from DEM(s)</h3>

<div>One or more DEM(s) sources have to be defined, as well a source profile line. The line can derive from a source line layer,
a on-the-fly-digitized line or a list of points.</div>

<br />
<div>
    When using a line layer, all the elements will be used, irrespective of eventual selections in the layer.
    Multiple lines will be merged into a single line, based on the chosen order field when available,
    or otherwise based on the internal line order. Some errors in derived profiles can be due to erroneous line ordering,
    not adjusted via the choice of a correct sequential order stored in an integer field (order values start from 1).
</div>
<br />
<div>
	When directly digitizing a line in the map, you add points wtih left clicks, and stops a line with a right click.
</div>
<br />
<div>
	It is also possible to define the profile as a list point coordinates.
	Each point is defined by a x-y coordinates pair, comma-separated, on a single row, for instance:
	<br /><i>549242.7, 242942.2</i>
	<br /><i>578370.3, 322634.5</i>
</div>
<br />

	<br /><br />Fig. 1. The plugin interface for topographic profile creation from DEM(s).
</div>
<br />
<div>
	The elevation statistics along the profile for each chosen DEM may be calculate with the "<i>Calculate profile statistics</i>" button.
	These statistics can be used as a help in the definition of the profile plot minimum and maximum elevations ("<i>plot z min value</i>"
	and "<i>plot z max value</i>" options). Otherwise, automatic values will be applied.
</div>
<br />
<div>
	You may define the "<i>Line densify distance</i>" option, i.e. the distance between consecutive sampling point automatically added
	when the original vertices of the used path have distances larger than this value.
	It is advisable to use a value comparable to the resolution of the used DEM,
	for instance 30 m for Aster DEMs. A suggested value is added automatically based on the resolution
	of the DEM with the highest spatial resolution.
    </div>
<br />
<div>
	By using "<i>Invert profile line orientation</i>", the profile line will have its orientation inverted, i.e., the start will become
	the end and the former end will become the profile start.
	<br />With the option "<i>Flip x-axis direction</i>", the start of the x-axis in the plot will be at the right, not at the left,
	so that distances will increase from left to right.
</div>
<br />
<div>
	The profile plot is created by using the "<i>Create profile</i>" button. Sometimes the plot creation may require more than just a few
	seconds, so please be patient... ;)

<h3>2.2 Topographic profile creation from GPX</h3>
<div>
	Topographic pofiles can be created also using as a source GPX files.
	Beware that in the current version, profile lines with only two points (start and end points) may be used for geological
	data projections and intersections. So if you just want to create a topographic profile, GPX profile sources are fine.
	In future releases, the only-two-points constraint for geological intersections should be removed.

<h2>3. Geological element projections on the profile</h2>

Having defined and calculated a profile as previously described,
it is also possible to project geological attitudes or traces on the section.

<h3>3.1 Projection of geological attitudes</h3>

The geological attitudes source is a point layer: just selected points will be projected,
unless, in case of no selection, all points will be projected.

	<img src="images/Fig_04.png" style="align:middle; max_width: 80%"/>
	<br /><br />Fig. 4. The plugin interface for geological attitude projections on the profile.
</div>


<br /> <br />Required fields are the geological point <i>id</i> and its surface orientation, expressed by <i>dip direction</i> and 
<i>dip angle</i> values.
<br />The geological attitudes can be projected on the section plane according to three
methods: 1) nearest point; 2) projection along a common axis; 3) projection along individual 
axes, for each geological record.
<br /> <br />When choosing the <i>Along axis projection - individual axes</i> option, <i>trend</i> and <i>plunge</i> fields,
storing the fold axis values along which to project each observation, are required in the source point layer. 
<br /><br />The results can be exported both as a csv file or as a 3D point shapefile.

</div>

<h3>3.2 Projection of geological lines</h3>
Geological traces can be projected on the section plane, based on a fold axis for which
trend and plunge values have to be defined.

</div>

<br />
<h2>4. Intersections of geological elements</h2>
It is possible to determine the intersections of the profile (composed by just two points) with lines ("<i>Intersect line layer</i>") 
or with polygons ("<i>Intersect polygon layer</i>"), representing geological features.
An <i>Id</i> field and a <i>Classification</i> field can be provided, as an aid in plot visualization.

<h2>5. Result export</h2>

<div>
	The last created figure can be saved as PDF, svg or tif. The export graphic parameters can
be saved in a text file and loaded for applying them to further plots.
<br /><br />Result data can be exported ad shapefiles or csv files. Depending on the data type,
the output geometric formats can be line or point. The exported data CRS will be the same CRS defined for
the QGis project.
</div>
<br />
<div>Note: the slope is saved as relative (positive when upward, negative when downward), even if plotted as absolute.
To change to absolute value, apply the absolute function on the relative field in a GIS or spreadsheet software.
